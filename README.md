# SPADE Oxygen Solver
An attempt to verify some simulations in [Microvessel Chaste](https://github.com/vedangnarain/MicrovesselChaste/tree/Vedang) with [SPADE (Static Polymorphic Algorithms for Differential Equations)](https://github.com/wvannoordt/spade
).

## To Run

The variable we solve for is c/c_ref. In the terminal, run:

1. `make`
2. `./vdf.x input.sdf`
